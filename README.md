# ðŸ“– Getting started

**Fiber** is an [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) inspired **web framework** build on top of [Fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp), the **fastest** HTTP engine for [Go](https://golang.org/doc/). Designed to **ease** things up for **fast** development with **zero memory allocation** and **performance** in mind.

## Installation

First of all, [download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install Go. `1.13` or higher is required.

Installation is done using the [`go get`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Add_dependencies_to_current_module_and_install_them) command:

```bash
go get -u github.com/gofiber/fiber
```

## Zero Allocation

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some values returned from \***fiber.Ctx** are **not** immutable by default
{% endhint %}

Because fiber is optimized for **high-performance**, values returned from **fiber.Ctx** are **not** immutable by default and **will** be re-used across requests. As a rule of thumb, you **must** only use context values within the handler, and you **must not** keep any references. As soon as you return from the handler, any values you have obtained from the context will be re-used in future requests and will change below your feet. Here is an example:

```go
func handler(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    // Variable is only valid within this handler
    result := c.Params("foo") 
    
    // ...
}
```

If you need to persist such values outside the handler, make copies of their **underlying buffer** using the [copy](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#copy) builtin. Here is an example for persisting a string:

```go
func handler(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    // Variable is only valid within this handler
    result := c.Params("foo")
    
    // Make a copy
    buffer := make([]byte, len(result))
    copy(buffer, result)
    resultCopy := string(buffer) 
    // Variable is now valid forever
    
    // ...
}
```

We created a custom `ImmutableString` a function that does the above and is available in the [gofiber/utils](https://github.com/gofiber/utils) package.

```go
app.Get("/:foo", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    // Variable is now immutable
    result := utils.ImmutableString(c.Params("foo")) 
    
    // ...
})
```

Alternatively, you can also use the[ **Immutable setting**](app.md#settings). It will make all values returned from the context immutable, allowing you to persist them anywhere. Of course, this comes at the cost of performance.

## Hello, World!

Embedded below is essentially the most straightforward **Fiber** app, which you can create.

```go
package main

import "github.com/gofiber/fiber"

func main() {
  app := fiber.New()

  app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    return c.SendString("Hello, World!")
  })

  app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

```text
go run server.go
```

Browse to `http://localhost:3000,` and you should see `Hello, World!` on the page.

## Basic routing

Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI \(or path\) and a specific HTTP request method \(GET, PUT, POST and so on\).

{% hint style="info" %}
Each route can have **multiple handler functions**, that is executed when the route is matched.
{% endhint %}

Route definition takes the following structures:

```go
// Function signature
app.Method(path string, ...func(*fiber.Ctx) error)
```

* `app` is an instance of **Fiber**.
* `Method` is an [HTTP request method](https://fiber.wiki/application#methods), in capitalization: `Get`, `Put`, `Post`, etc.
* `path` is a virtual path on the server.
* `func(*fiber.Ctx) error` is a callback function containing the [Context](https://fiber.wiki/context) executed when the route is matched.

**Simple route**

```go
// Respond with "Hello, World!" on root path, "/"
app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
  return c.SendString("Hello, World!")
})
```

**Parameters**

```go
// GET http://localhost:8080/hello%20world

app.Get("/:value", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
  return c.SendString("value: " + c.Params("value"))
  // => Get request with value: hello world
})
```

**Optional parameter**

```go
// GET http://localhost:3000/john

app.Get("/:name?", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
  if c.Params("name") != "" {
    return c.SendString("Hello " + c.Params("name"))
    // => Hello john
  }
  return c.SendString("Where is john?")
})
```

**Wildcards**

```go
// GET http://localhost:3000/api/user/john

app.Get("/api/*", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
  return c.SendString("API path: " + c.Params("*"))
  // => API path: user/john
})
```

## Static files

To serve static files such as **images**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** files, replace your function handler with a file or directory string.

Function signature:

```go
app.Static(prefix, root string)
```

Use the following code to serve files in a directory named `./public`:

```go
app := fiber.New()

app.Static("/", "./public") 

app.Listen(":3000")
```

Now, you can load the files that are in the `./public` directory:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/hello.html
http://localhost:8080/js/jquery.js
http://localhost:8080/css/style.css
```
